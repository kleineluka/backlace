The Backlace License (Version 1.0)

Copyright (c) 2025 Zoey (KleineLuka)

This software, "Backlace" ("the Software"), is provided under the terms of this license. It is a source-available license that grants broad permissions for use, modification, and distribution, similar to the MIT License, but with a few key restrictions designed to protect the sustainability of the project.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files, to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. Preservation of Notice:
The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

2. Public Attribution:
Any project that uses, builds upon, or is derived from the Software must include a clear and visible attribution to "Backlace" on its primary public-facing page (such as a repository README, a store page, or a project website), including a link back to the original Backlace project on Github.

3. Restriction on Direct Resale:
You may not sell, rent, or lease the Software as a standalone commercial product. To include the Software as part of a larger commercial product, that product must constitute a "Transformative Work." A Transformative Work is one that adds significant new features, functionality, or creative content beyond that of the Software itself. Simply rebranding or repackaging the Software is not considered transformative.

4. In-Software Credit:
Any user-facing graphical interface that makes use of the Software's functionality (such as a shader's user interface) must display the notice "Built off of Backlace" in a location that is reasonably visible to the end-user. This notice should, where possible, be a hyperlink to the original Backlace project on Github. For something that is much more transformative and bigger in scale, such as a game, this credit can be included in the game's credits section.
