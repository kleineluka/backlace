## 3. Commercial Use and Resale Restrictions

You may not sell the Software by itself, in a nearly identical form, or as a simple re-packaging. Commercial distribution is permitted only if the Software is part of a larger, transformative work that adds significant value, original code, or creativity (e.g., a game, a complete avatar, or a heavily modified shader system with distinct new features).

## 4. Protected Core Components
