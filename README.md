# Backlace üíó
Backlace is a standard and toon shader for Unity and VRChat whose primary function is to serve as a base for other shaders. An example use case for Backlace would be wanting to make a shader that implements a specific special effect but not wanting to build a lighting system from scratch.

> [!CAUTION]
> **This is inherently not a replacement for all-in-one shaders (ex. LilToon, Poiyomi, etc.). As such, many features are a na√Øve implementation.** While fully usable as a stand-alone shader, it is much more lightweight.
