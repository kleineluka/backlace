# Backlace ðŸ’—
Base Toon Shader for VRChat & Unity. Forked from [Toony Rebuild](https://github.com/VRLabs/Toony-Standard-Rebuild/tree/main) which is under the [MIT License](https://github.com/VRLabs/Toony-Standard-Rebuild/blob/main/LICENSE). More information (license, features, etc.) will be added as the shader is (re-)built.

## Notice

This shader is intended as a base for other shaders, not necessarily a stand-alone shader. It is also primarily intended for *me*, but I figured it may be helpful to share with the community, as I am also using tools from the community in this process.
