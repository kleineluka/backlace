# Backlace üíó
Backlace is a standard and toon shader for Unity and VRChat. It's primary function is to provide a base for other shaders, but it can also be used as a stand-alone shader. A good use case for this shader would be, for instance, wanting to make a shader that implements a specific special effect but not wanting to build a lighting system from scratch. While fully usable as a stand-alone shader, it is much more lightweight.

> [!CAUTION]
> **This is inherently not a replacement for all-in-one shaders (ex. LilToon, Poiyomi, etc.). As such, many features are a na√Øve implementation.**

## Notice
This shader is intended as a base for other shaders, not necessarily a stand-alone shader. It is also primarily intended for me to use, so the needs of it may be a bit specific to my use case.
