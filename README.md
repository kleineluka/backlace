# Backlace ðŸ’—
Base Toon Shader for VRChat & Unity. **This is a base to build your work off of, not a replacement for all-in-one shaders (ex. LilToon, Poiyomi, etc.). As such, many features are a naÃ¯ve implementation.**

## License

Anything in the [Editor](https://github.com/kleineluka/backlace/tree/main/Resources/Luka_Backlace/Editor) folder in this repository is strictly not for redistribution under any circumstances. This code is provided as a demo UI, and has all of my socials and metadata hard-coded, so you do not want to redistribute this anyways.

The shader itself is under MIT.

## Notice

This shader is intended as a base for other shaders, not necessarily a stand-alone shader. It is also primarily intended for me to use, so the needs of it may be a bit specific to my use case.
