**The Backlace License 2.0**

Copyright (c) 2026 Zoey (KleineLuka)

This software, "Backlace" ("the Software"), is licensed under a dual-scope agreement depending on your use case. By using the Software, you agree to the applicable scope below, as well as the Backlace Terms of Use.

While most users will fall under **Scope A**, if your use falls within both **Scope A** and **Scope B**, **Scope B** shall apply.

---

## Scope A: Content Creation

If you are using the Software to render graphics for a larger creative project, **you are granted broad, unrestricted use similar to the MIT License.**

Permission is granted, free of charge, to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software as an integrated part of your project. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. Distribution of compiled builds that contain the Software does not constitute redistribution of the Software in source form.

Examples of **Scope A** include, but are not limited to, the following: VRChat Avatars/Worlds, Game Development, Animation Projects, Digital Illustrations, Game Modding and Fan Works, VTubing, Films, Music Videos, DJ Sets, 3D Rendering, and any other creative endeavor where the Software is used as a tool to produce content. These may be distributed commercially or non-commercially at your discretion.

## Scope B: Derivative Tools

If you are modifying the Software to create a derivative shader, technical asset, or developer tool, your rights are subject to the following restrictions:

- No As-Is Resale: You may not sell the Software by itself, in a nearly identical form, or as a simple re-packaging. Commercial distribution is only permitted if the resulting product is not a substitute for the Software and introduces substantial independent functionality.
- Visible Attribution: You must include the credit "Built off of Backlace" in a visible portion of your tool's user interface, accompanied by a link to the official Backlace GitHub repository.
- Protected Components: You may modify Protected Components for private/internal use. You may not redistribute modified versions of Protected Components without explicit written permission. Protected Components include files provided within the "Editor" and "Processor" folders in the original Software distribution.

Examples of **Scope B** include, but are not limited to, the following: Derivative Shaders, Shader Graph Nodes, Engine Ports, Technical Add-Ons/Extensions (such as making a new feature for the Software), Unity Scripts, Shader Packs, Platform Ports, Forks, and any other tool or asset that is directly derived from the original Software and intended for distribution to other developers.

## Branding and No Endorsement

This License does not grant permission to use the "Backlace Shader" name or branding in a manner that implies endorsement.

## Termination

Any violation of this License automatically terminates the rights granted herein. Upon termination, you must cease all distribution and use of the Software until compliance is restored.

## Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.


## Backlace Terms of Use (Software Behaviour)

By installing and running the Backlace software in your development environment (e.g., Unity Editor), you acknowledge and agree to the following system behaviours:
- Local File Access: The Software will write/read files to/from your local storage for functional purposes. This includes saving/loading presets, generating compact shaders, and caching data.
- Network Requests: The Software may make outgoing web requests solely for the purpose of checking metadata or looking for updates.
- Data Privacy: No personally identifiable information (PII) is transmitted during these network requests.
- Production Exclusion: Network functionality is strictly limited to the development environment. It is excluded from compiled builds (e.g., exported games or applications) and can be manually disabled by the user in the settings. All editor code is conditionally compiled to ensure it does not affect runtime performance or security in production builds.

Most importantly: enjoy using Backlace and happy creating!
