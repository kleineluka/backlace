The Backlace License (Version 1.3)

Copyright (c) 2025 Zoey (KleineLuka)

This software, "Backlace" ("the Software"), is provided under the terms of this license. It is a source-available license that grants broad permissions for use, modification, and distribution, but with a few key restrictions designed to protect the sustainability of the project.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files, to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

## Exemption Notice:
This license applies only to the Backlace shader and related source files. Certain included components are not covered by this license. Those files are distributed for use only and are subject to their own license. For further details, please see the files and their respective licenses:
- Files in Resources/Luka_Backlace/Editor are subject to the Dazzle License (see Resources/Luka_Backlace/Licenses/Dazzle.md).
- Files in Resources/Luka_Backlace/Processor are subject to the Premonitions License (see Resources/Luka_Backlace/Licenses/Premonitions.md).

## 1. Preservation of Notice
Keep this license and the copyright notice intact in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

## 2. Give Credit
If your project uses or builds on Backlace, show clear credit to “Backlace” somewhere visible (for example, in your README, credits, or about page) with a link to the official GitHub page.

## 3. No Simple Resales
You can’t sell the Software by itself or in nearly identical form. You can, however, include it in a larger, original, or modified work - basically, something that adds real new value or creativity.

## 4. Derivative Shaders Notice
If you create a shader or similar technical tool that directly builds on Backlace, include the phrase “Built off of Backlace” in a visible part of its user interface, ideally with a link to the original GitHub page. This requirement does not apply to works using such shaders (like avatars, worlds, or games).
